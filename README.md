# countryInfo
Java desktop app window for searching information about countries from API.
The application allows you to select the continent on which the country, whose information you want to see, is located. 
Then, from the range of 2 to 10, we select the number of countries we want to search from that continent. 
On the right side, buttons with the names of the countries will appear, and by clicking on them, a window will pop up showing information about that country. 
Enjoy exploring! :smiley:
